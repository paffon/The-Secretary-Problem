A lightweight simulation to optimize the famous mathematical problem:
## The Secretary Problem


Based on the [Numberphile video about toilets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWib5olGbQ0)

And the [article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem)

## Simulation results

### Interpretation:

When the aim is to achieve the highest possible score on average, it's visible that relatively low amount of pre-checks is required.
For 100 total data points, it's enough to check ~5% to achieve the highest score possible, on average.

### Interpretation:

When the aim is to achieve the absolute best score, it's visible that it is required to sample between 35%-50% of the data points before making a decision. This is consistent with theoretical findings and analysis.
